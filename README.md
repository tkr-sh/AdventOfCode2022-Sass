# AdventOfCode2022-Sass
This is my advent of code in Sass (Scss)

## Informations
The version of Scss used is:
`1.56.1 compiled with dart2js 2.18.4`

## How to run a program
To run a program you only have to type `bash ../run.sh` on the directory you're in 

## Note
Functions in `functions.scss` are written by me.<br>
If you want to use them or to upgrade them, feel free to do so :)!
